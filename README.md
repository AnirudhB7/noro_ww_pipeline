# noro\_ww\_pipeline â€” Wastewater Surveillance of Norovirus

**Oneâ€‘liner:** A shortâ€‘read amplicon pipeline to type **Norovirus** in **wastewater** by sequencing the **RdRpâ†’VP1 (BC) junction**, enabling simultaneous **Gâ€‘type (VP1)** and **Pâ€‘type (RdRp)** calls.

## Why Norovirus & why wastewater?

* **Norovirus matters.** Norovirus is the major cause of gastroenteritis cases worldwide and in the USA. Globally, Norovirus is responsible for approximately 18% of all clinical cases of gastroenteritis and an estimated 207,000 deaths each year. 
* **Wastewater works.** Wastewater-based epidemiology combined with genomic sequencing, allows the tracking viral strains such SARS-CoV-2, Polio, RSV etc. in real time, allowing for early detection and better public health response. However, there remains a significant gap in applying wastewater surveillance methods for Norovirus.

## Why the **BC (RdRpâ†’VP1) junction**?

Norovirus genomes encode nonâ€‘structural proteins in **ORF1** (including **RdRp**) and capsid proteins in **ORF2** (**VP1**). The **BC junction** lies at the interface of RdRp and VP1 and is a hotspot for recombination. By amplifying this junction (\~**579Â nt** in **GI**; \~**570Â nt** in **GII**), a **single merged read** carries both:

* **Pâ€‘type** information (from **RdRp**, ORF1) and
* **Gâ€‘type** information (from **VP1**, ORF2).

This pairing enables dual typing of Norovirus.




## Our innovation

**Wetâ€‘lab input to this pipeline**

* **dPCR screening** of wastewater extracts.
* **PCR** targeting the BC region (GI/GII assays).
* **Illumina 2Ã—300Â bp** sequencing to allow full amplicon recovery.

**Dryâ€‘lab pipeline (this repo)**

1. **QC**: fastp â†’ TrimÂ Galore (Q20, error=0.2; Nextera/Illumina adapters).
2. **Merge**: BBMerge; record insertâ€‘size histogram.
3. **Rightâ€‘size select**: keep **570â€“580Â nt** merged reads (junction amplicon).
4. **QIIMEÂ 2 / VSEARCH path**: import (singleâ€‘end), **dereplicate**, **deÂ novo 99% clustering**.
5. **References**: download HUCAT, reâ€‘header (add G/P labels), **extract BC region** by multiple primer sets, merge refs.
6. **Train classifier** (Naive Bayes) on BCâ€‘region refs + taxonomy; **test classifier** on sample reps.
7. **Assign taxonomy** (Gâ€‘type, Pâ€‘type).
8. **Relative abundance**: executed notebook summarizes genotype/Pâ€‘type composition across samples.

## What we observed (pilot summary)

* In **GenogroupÂ I (GI)** samples, the most abundant variant was **GI.1Â P\[1]**.
* In **GenogroupÂ II (GII)** samples, the most abundant variant was **GII.4Â P\[39]**.

## Longâ€‘term vision

* **Routine genotypeâ€‘level WBE:** nearâ€‘realâ€‘time dashboards of G/P types across catchments.
* **Benchmarking:** sideâ€‘byâ€‘side ASV path for higher resolution and validation.

## Whatâ€™s in this repo (minimal)

* **Snakemake workflow** from FASTQs â†’ merged junction reads â†’ QIIMEÂ 2/VSEARCH typing.
* **Env files** for reproducible installs; **config** with autoâ€‘discovery of multiple samples.
* **Ref utilities** to prepare HUCATâ€‘based BCâ€‘region training data.
